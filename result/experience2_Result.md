# Version(sys+uml) Model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 Temperature: 0
## Prompt:
Based on the <System functional requirements> and <UML class diagram> provided as input, generate a complete Java code.
# Input:
- System functional requirements: The system functional requirements are as follows:
1) Manage person information, including name and identifier. 
+ Track parent-child relationships between persons. Every Person is the child of another person (except for one root Person who has no parent). Every Person can have an indeterminate number of children.
+ Track ancestors of a Person. A person has an indeterminate number of ancestors (e.g., father, grandfather, etc.). The ancestors of a Person are their father and the ancestors of their father.
+ Calculate the degree of each ancestor of a Person. The degree is 1 for the father, 2 for the grandfather.

2) Manage resource information. Each resouce has a name. 
+ There are two types of resources: Files and Folders. Each Folder can contain an indeterminate number of Resources  (both Files and Folders).
+ Each resource belongs to a Folder and cannot exist outside of a Folder. However, there will be one root Folder that does not belong to any other Folder.

3) Manage user information. The user is a specialized type of person, in addition to a name and an identifier, also has a password to access resources. 
+ Manage access permissions. A user can access an indeterminate number of resources. Each Resource can be accessed by an indeterminate number of Users. Ensure that permissions (view/edit) are enforced for each User-Resource pair.
+ Track whether a User has view and/or edit permissions for each Resource.

Based on the <System functional requirements>  provided as input, generate a complete Java code.
## Input:
- System functional requirements: The system functional requirements are as follows:
1) Manage person information, including name and identifier. 
+ Track parent-child relationships between persons. Every Person is the child of another person (except for one root Person who has no parent). Every Person can have an indeterminate number of children.
+ Track ancestors of a Person. A person has an indeterminate number of ancestors (e.g., father, grandfather, etc.). The ancestors of a Person are their father and the ancestors of their father.
+ Search the degree of each ancestor of a Person. The degree is 1 for the father, 2 for the grandfather.

2) Manage resource information. Each resouce has a name. 
+ There are two types of resources: Files and Folders. Each Folder can contain an indeterminate number of Resources (both Files and Folders).
+ Each resource belongs to a Folder and cannot exist outside of a Folder. However, there will be one root Folder that does not belong to any other Folder.

3) Manage user information. The user is a specialized type of person, in addition to a name and an identifier, also has a password to access resources. 
+ A user can access an indeterminate number of resources. Each Resource can be accessed by an indeterminate number of Users. 
+ Add/Remove an accessible resource for users, and specify viewing and editing permissions.
+ Search whether a User has view and/or edit permission for the Resource.
+ The user can edit/view the resouce content if and only if the user has editing/viewing rights.

# Version(sys) Model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 Temperature: 0
## Prompt: # Task: 
Based on the <System functional requirements>  provided as input, generate a complete Java code.
## Input:
- System functional requirements: The system functional requirements are as follows:
1) Manage person information, including name and identifier. 
+ Track parent-child relationships between persons. Every Person is the child of another person (except for one root Person who has no parent). Every Person can have an indeterminate number of children.
+ Track ancestors of a Person. A person has an indeterminate number of ancestors (e.g., father, grandfather, etc.). The ancestors of a Person are their father and the ancestors of their father.
+ Search the degree of each ancestor of a Person. The degree is 1 for the father, 2 for the grandfather.

2) Manage resource information. Each resouce has a name. 
+ There are two types of resources: Files and Folders. Each Folder can contain an indeterminate number of Resources (both Files and Folders).
+ Each resource belongs to a Folder and cannot exist outside of a Folder. However, there will be one root Folder that does not belong to any other Folder.

3) Manage user information. The user is a specialized type of person, in addition to a name and an identifier, also has a password to access resources. 
+ A user can access an indeterminate number of resources. Each resource can be accessed by an indeterminate number of Users. 
+ A user can search all accesible resources for a user.
+ A user can change the file content if and only if the user has editing/viewing rights.

4) Manage access control. 
+ Grant/Revoke users access to specified resources, including viewing and editing permissions.
+ Check whether the user has permission to view/edit the specified resource.

This Java code provides a basic structure based on the given system requirements and UML class diagram. You can further enhance and expand the functionality by adding more methods and fields as needed. Let me know if you need any more assistance.

# Version(sys) Model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 Temperature: 0
## Prompt: # Task: 
Based on the <System functional requirements>  provided as input, generate a complete Java code.
## Input:
- System functional requirements: The system functional requirements are as follows:
1) Manage person information, including name and identifier. 
+ Track parent-child relationships between persons. Every Person is the child of another person (except for one root Person who has no parent). Every Person can have an indeterminate number of children.
+ Track ancestors of a Person. A person has an indeterminate number of ancestors (e.g., father, grandfather, etc.). The ancestors of a Person are their father and the ancestors of their father.
+ Search the degree of each ancestor of a Person. The degree is 1 for the father, 2 for the grandfather.

2) Manage resource information. Each resouce has a name. 
+ There are two types of resources: Files and Folders. Each Folder can contain an indeterminate number of Resources (both Files and Folders).
+ Each resource belongs to a Folder and cannot exist outside of a Folder. However, there will be one root Folder that does not belong to any other Folder.

3) Manage user information. The user is a specialized type of person, in addition to a name and an identifier, also has a password to access resources. 
+ A user can access an indeterminate number of resources. Each resource can be accessed by an indeterminate number of Users. 
+ A user can search all accesible resources.
+ A user can edit the file content only if the user has editing access.

4) Manage access control. 
+ Grant/Revoke users access to specified resources, including viewing and editing permissions.
+ Check whether the user has permission to view/edit the specified resource.



## Note:
- Generate Java code, including classes, fields, and implementations of methods.
- You are free to add helper methods and fields in the code if needed.
- Code should be as error-free as possible and conform to Java coding standards and best practices.
- The code should include necessary comments.
