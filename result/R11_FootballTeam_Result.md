## Description:
足球管理系统，包含以下需求：
1）管理球员信息，包括所属球队、姓名、年龄和球衣号码。
2）转会操作。允许将足球运动员调入或调出足球队。支持将足球运动员卖给其他足球队的操作。
3）配置首发阵容。首发阵容必须包含11名球员（含1名守门员），至少1名前锋球员，至少2名中场球员，至少3名后卫球员，仅1名守门员。
4）配置替补球员，最多7名替补球员，且不可同时出现在首发阵容中。
5）只有注册球队的球员才能加入比赛阵容。
6）添加/删除球员。新球员必须完成注册才能加入球队。

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as team, name, age, number, position, and registration status. It includes methods for registration and unregistration.

2. **Team Class**: Represents a football team with methods to add, remove, transfer, and sell players. It ensures that only registered players can be added to the team.

3. **MatchEvent Class**: Represents a match event with methods to configure and validate the starting lineup and substitutes. It checks the rules for the starting lineup configuration.

4. **Position Enum**: Defines the possible positions a player can have.

This code adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, including proper encapsulation, error handling, and method documentation.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Player Class**: Represents a football player with attributes like name, age, jersey number, position, and the team they belong to.
2. **Team Class**: Represents a football team that can manage its players, including adding/removing players, transferring players, and configuring starting lineups and substitutes.
3. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Manages multiple teams and provides methods to register and unregister teams.
4. **Main Class**: Demonstrates the functionality of the system by creating teams and players, adding players to teams, and configuring starting lineups and substitutes.

### Key Features:
- Validations for starting lineup and substitutes.
- Transfer functionality between teams.
- Error handling for player management.

This code adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, including encapsulation, proper naming conventions, and comments for clarity.

# Version(sys+uml) Model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 Temperature: 0
## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match event. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute players in each match event, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only registered team players can join the match event.
6) Add/remove players. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team.

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as team, name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status. It includes a constructor and getter/setter methods.

2. **Team Class**: Represents a football team with methods to add, remove, transfer, and sell players. It maintains a list of players.

3. **MatchEvent Class**: Represents a match event with methods to configure the starting lineup and substitutes. It validates the starting lineup based on the specified rules.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate the functionality of the system by creating teams, players, and a match event, and configuring lineups.

This code adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, including encapsulation, method naming conventions, and proper use of collections.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match event. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute players in each match event, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only registered team players can join the match event.
6) Add/remove players. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Player Class**: Represents a football player with attributes like name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status. It includes methods for registration and accessing player details.

2. **Team Class**: Manages a list of players, allows adding/removing players, and handles player transfers. It also configures the starting lineup and substitutes while enforcing the rules specified in the requirements.

3. **MatchEvent Class**: Represents a match event between two teams and includes a method to start the match.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: The main class that demonstrates the functionality of the system by creating players, teams, configuring lineups, and starting a match.

### Key Features:
- The code checks for the validity of lineups and substitutes based on the specified rules.
- Players must be registered before being added to a team.
- The transfer operation allows players to be moved between teams.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a football management system based on the specified requirements.

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as team, name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status. It includes a constructor and getter methods.

2. **Team Class**: Represents a football team with methods to add, remove, transfer, and sell players. It ensures that only registered players can be added to the team.

3. **MatchEvent Class**: Represents a match event with methods to configure the starting lineup and substitutes. It validates the starting lineup based on the specified rules.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate the functionality of the system, including adding players, configuring lineups, and handling registration.

This code adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, including encapsulation, method validation, and clear comments for better understanding.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, registered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match event. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute players in each match event, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only registered team players can join the match event.
6) Add/remove players. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team.
7) The team can participate in multiple match events, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match event.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Player Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as name, age, registration status, jersey number, position, and the team they belong to. It includes methods for registration and getting player details.

2. **Team Class**: Represents a football team with methods to add/remove players, transfer players, and configure starting and substitute lineups. It ensures that the lineups meet the specified requirements.

3. **MatchEvent Class**: Represents a match event between two teams. It can be expanded to include match logic.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: The main class that demonstrates the functionality of the system by creating teams, players, configuring lineups, and starting a match.

### Notes:
- The code includes error handling for various scenarios, such as ensuring that only registered players can be added to teams and that lineups meet the specified criteria.
- The `main` method serves as a demonstration of how the classes interact and can be used to manage a football team and its players.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, registered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute players in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only registered team players can join the match.
6) Add/remove players. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team.
7) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Player Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as name, age, registration status, jersey number, position, and the team they belong to. It includes methods for registration and getting player details.

2. **Team Class**: Represents a football team with methods to add/remove players, transfer players, and configure starting and substitute lineups. It ensures that the lineups meet the specified requirements.

3. **Match Class**: Represents a match between two teams and includes a method to start the match.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: The main class that demonstrates the functionality of the system by creating teams, players, configuring lineups, and starting a match.

### Key Features:
- The code checks for registration before adding players to a team.
- It validates the starting lineup and substitutes according to the specified rules.
- It allows for player transfers between teams.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a football management system based on the specified requirements.

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status. It includes methods for registration and accessing player details.

2. **Team Class**: Represents a football team with methods to add, remove, transfer, and sell players. It ensures that only registered players can be added to the team.

3. **MatchEvent Class**: Represents a match event, including methods to configure and validate the starting lineup and substitutes. It checks the requirements for the starting lineup based on the specified rules.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate how to use the classes. It creates a team, adds players, and configures match events.

This code adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, including encapsulation, method naming conventions, and comments for clarity.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Add/remove players. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team.
7) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Player Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as name, age, registered status, jersey number, position, and the team they belong to. It includes methods for registration and getting player details.

2. **Team Class**: Represents a football team with methods to add/remove players, transfer players, and configure starting and substitute lineups. It checks lineup validity based on the specified requirements.

3. **Match Class**: Represents a match between two teams. It can be expanded to include match logic.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: The main class that demonstrates the functionality of the system by creating teams, players, configuring lineups, and starting a match.

### Comments:
- The code includes comments to explain the purpose of each class and method.
- Error handling is implemented to ensure that the requirements are met when configuring lineups and managing players.
- The code is structured to be easily extendable for future features or modifications.

5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Add/remove players. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team. Note that remove player operation will remove the player from the team and the lineup.
7) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a player with attributes like name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status. It includes methods for registration and unregistration.

2. **Team Class**: Manages a list of players, allowing for adding, removing, transferring, and selling players. It ensures that only registered players can be added.

3. **MatchEvent Class**: Manages match details, including starting and substitute lineups. It validates lineups based on the specified requirements.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate how to use the classes. It creates teams and players, registers them, and configures match lineups.

This code adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, including encapsulation, method validation, and clear comments for better understanding.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Add/remove players. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team. Note that remove player operation will remove the player from the team and the lineup.
7) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Player Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as name, age, registered status, jersey number, position, and the team they belong to. It includes methods for registration and getting player details.

2. **Team Class**: Represents a football team with methods to add and remove players, transfer players between teams, and configure starting and substitute lineups. It ensures that the lineups meet the specified requirements.

3. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate the functionality of the system. It creates teams and players, registers players, configures lineups, and performs player transfers.

### Key Features:
- The code checks for registration before adding players to a team.
- It validates the starting and substitute lineups based on the specified rules.
- It allows for player transfers between teams while ensuring proper management of player lists.

This implementation adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, including encapsulation, method naming conventions, and error handling.

2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Add/remove players from the team. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team. Note that remove players from the team will remove the player from the team and the lineup.
7) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Player Class**: Represents a football player with attributes like name, age, registered status, jersey number, and position. It includes methods for registration and accessing player details.

2. **Team Class**: Represents a football team that manages players, starting lineups, and substitute lineups. It includes methods for adding/removing players, transferring players, and configuring lineups according to the specified rules.

3. **Match Class**: Represents a match between two teams. It can be expanded to include match logic.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: The main class that demonstrates the functionality of the system by creating teams, players, configuring lineups, and starting a match.

### Comments:
- The code includes comments to explain the purpose of each class and method.
- Error handling is implemented to ensure that the requirements are met when configuring lineups and managing players.
- The code adheres to Java coding standards and best practices.

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a player with attributes like name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status. It includes methods for registration and getters for the attributes.

2. **Team Class**: Manages a list of players, allowing adding, removing, and transferring players. It ensures that players must be registered before they can join the team.

3. **MatchEvent Class**: Manages the starting and substitute lineups for a match. It includes methods to configure and validate the starting lineup according to the specified rules.

4. **Main Class**: Demonstrates how to use the classes to create teams, register players, and configure match events.

This code adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, including proper encapsulation, error handling, and clear method signatures.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Player Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as name, age, registration status, jersey number, and position.
2. **Team Class**: Manages a list of players, starting lineup, and substitute lineup. It includes methods to add/remove players, transfer players, and configure lineups according to the specified rules.
3. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate the functionality of the system, including creating players, adding them to a team, and configuring lineups.

### Key Features:
- The code checks for lineup validity based on the specified requirements.
- Players can only be added to lineups if they are part of the team.
- The transfer operation allows players to be moved between teams.
- The code is structured to follow Java coding standards and best practices, including proper encapsulation and method naming conventions.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Add/remove players from the lineup. New players must join in the team. 
7) Add/remove players from the team. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team. If player is removed from the team, also remove from any lineups in matches.
8) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as team, name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status.
2. **Team Class**: Manages a list of players, allowing for adding, removing, and transferring players.
3. **MatchEvent Class**: Manages match events, including starting and substitute lineups, with validation for lineup configurations.
4. **Main Class (FootballManagementSystem)**: Demonstrates the usage of the classes by creating a team, adding players, and configuring lineups for a match.

### Comments:
- The code includes comments to explain the purpose of each class and method.
- Error handling is included for invalid operations, such as adding unregistered players or configuring invalid lineups.
- The example usage in the `main` method illustrates how to use the classes to manage players and teams effectively.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Add/remove players to/from the starting or substitute lineup. New players must join in the team.
7) Add/remove players from the team. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team. If player is removed from the team, also remove from any lineups in matches.
8) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

## UML:

```plantuml

class FootballPlayer {
  - string team
  - string name
  - int age
  - int number
  - Position position
  - boolean isReigstered
}

class MatchEvent {

2. **Team Class**: Manages a list of players, starting lineup, and substitute lineup. It includes methods to add/remove players, transfer players between teams, and configure lineups according to the specified rules.

3. **Match Class**: Represents a match between two teams.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate the functionality of the system. It creates teams and players, registers them, configures lineups, and outputs the lineups.

### Error Handling:
The code includes error handling for various scenarios, such as ensuring players are registered before being added to a team, validating lineup configurations, and ensuring players are not duplicated in lineups.

This implementation adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, ensuring clarity and maintainability.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Add/remove players to/from the starting or substitute lineup. New players must join in the team.
7) Add/remove players from the team. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team. If player is removed from the team, also remove from any lineups in matches.
8) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a player with attributes such as name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status. It includes methods for registration and unregistration.

2. **MatchEvent Class**: Manages the starting and substitute lineups for a match. It includes methods to configure and validate the starting lineup, as well as to configure the substitute lineup.

3. **Team Class**: Represents a football team and manages its players. It includes methods to add, remove, transfer, and sell players.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate the usage of the classes.

### Notes:
- The code includes error handling for various operations, such as validating lineups and ensuring players are registered before being added to a team.
- The `removePlayerFromTeam` method in the `Team` class is designed to remove a player from the team and should also handle removing the player from any match lineups, which would require additional context not provided in the original requirements.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Add/remove players to/from the starting or substitute lineup. New players must join in the team.
7) Add/remove players from the team. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team. When a player is requested to be removed from a team, the player must be removed from all match lineups simultaneously.
8) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Enums and Classes**: The `Position` enum defines the possible positions for players. The `FootballPlayer`, `MatchEvent`, and `Team` classes encapsulate the properties and behaviors of players, match events, and teams, respectively.

2. **FootballPlayer Class**: This class contains attributes for player details and methods for registration.

3. **MatchEvent Class**: This class manages the starting and substitute lineups, including methods for configuring and validating lineups.

4. **Team Class**: This class manages the team’s players, including adding/removing players, transferring players, and registering players.

5. **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling to ensure that the business rules are followed, such as validating lineups and ensuring players are registered before joining a team.

This implementation adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, ensuring clarity and maintainability.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Add/remove players to/from the starting or substitute lineup. New players must join in the team.
7) Add/remove players from the team. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team. When a player is requested to be removed from a team, the player must be removed from all match lineups simultaneously.
8) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a player with attributes like name, age, team, jersey number, position, and registration status. It includes methods for registration and unregistration.

2. **MatchEvent Class**: Manages the starting and substitute lineups for a match. It includes methods to configure lineups and validate them according to the specified rules.

3. **Team Class**: Represents a football team and manages its players. It includes methods to add, remove, transfer, and sell players, ensuring that players are registered before being added to the team.

### Notes:
- The code includes error handling for various operations, ensuring that the business rules are enforced.
- The `getParticipatedMatches` method in the `Team` class is a placeholder and should be implemented to return actual match events for a complete system.
- The code adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, including proper encapsulation and method naming conventions.

1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as team, name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status. It includes methods for registration and unregistration.

2. **MatchEvent Class**: Manages the starting and substitute lineups for a match. It includes methods to configure lineups and validate them according to the specified rules.

3. **Team Class**: Represents a football team and manages its players. It includes methods to add, remove, transfer, and sell players, ensuring that players are registered before joining the team.

### Notes:
- The code adheres to Java coding standards and best practices.
- Error handling is implemented to ensure that the business rules are followed.
- The `getParticipatedMatches` method in the `Team` class is a placeholder and should be implemented to return actual match events for a complete system.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Add/remove players to/from the starting or substitute lineup. New players must join the team to be added to the lineup. Before removing a player from the lineup, determine whether the player is in the lineup.
7) Add/remove players from the team. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team. When a player is requested to be removed from a team, the player must be removed from all match lineups simultaneously.
8) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status. It includes methods for registration and getters for the attributes.

2. **Match Class**: Manages the starting and substitute lineups for a match. It includes methods to configure and validate the starting lineup and substitute lineup, as well as to remove players from both lineups.

3. **Team Class**: Represents a football team and manages its players. It includes methods to add, remove, transfer, and sell players.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate the functionality of the system, including creating teams, players, and matches.

### Notes:
- The code includes error handling for various operations, ensuring that the business rules are enforced.
- The example usage in the `main` method demonstrates how to create teams and players, register players, and configure match lineups.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Add/remove players to/from the specific lineup. Before removing a player from the lineup, validate whether the player is in the lineup.
7) Add/remove players to/from the team. New players must complete league registration and then be added to the team. When a player is requested to be removed from a team, the player must be removed from all match lineups simultaneously.
8) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

## UML:

```plantuml

  - string team
  - string name
  - int age
  - int number
  - Position position
  - boolean isReigstered
}

class Match {

  - List<FootballPlayer> startingLineup
  - List<FootballPlayer> substituteLineup
  
  + removePlayer()
  + configureStartingLineup()
  + validateStartingLineup()
  + configuresubstituteLineup()  
}
           
class Team {
  - name: String
  
  + addPlayer()
  + removePlayer()
  + transferPlayer()
  + sellPlayerTo(Team)
}

enum Position {

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Enumeration (Position)**: Defines the possible positions for a football player.

2. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status. It has methods to register the player.

3. **Match Class**: Manages the starting and substitute lineups for a match. It includes methods to configure lineups and validate the starting lineup according to the specified rules.

4. **Team Class**: Represents a football team. It manages adding, removing, and transferring players. Players must be registered before they can be added to the team.

5. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Contains the `main` method demonstrating how to use the classes to create teams and players, configure lineups, and handle matches.

### Note:
The code is structured to follow Java best practices and includes checks to ensure the integrity of the operations, such as validating lineups and ensuring players are registered before being added to a team.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Player Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as name, age, registration status, jersey number, and position. It includes methods for registration and accessing attributes.

2. **Team Class**: Represents a football team managing a list of players and match lineups. It includes methods to add/remove players, transfer players between teams, and configure match lineups.

3. **MatchLineup Class**: Manages the starting and substitute lineups for a match. It includes methods to add players to the lineups while validating constraints based on player positions and lineup limits.

4. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: The main class demonstrating the functionality of the football management system with examples of creating players, registering them, adding them to teams, and configuring match lineups.

### Comments and Validation:
- The code includes comments to clarify the purpose of classes and methods.
- Validations are performed to ensure that the lineup configurations adhere to the requirements (e.g., position constraints, lineup limits).
- The implementation is structured to ensure separation of concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend.

### Explanation:
1. **Classes**: The code defines three main classes: `FootballPlayer`, `Team`, and `Match`. Each class includes properties as specified in the UML diagram, along with constructors and methods to handle the required functionalities.

2. **Player Management**: The `Team` class allows for adding, removing, transferring, and selling players. The `FootballPlayer` class encapsulates player details.

3. **Match Management**: The `Match` class manages the starting and substitute lineups, including methods to configure these lineups and validate their correctness according to the specified rules.

4. **Validation Logic**: The `validateStartingLineup` method ensures that the starting lineup meets the requirements of player positions.

5. **Error Handling**: The code throws `IllegalArgumentException` when invalid operations are attempted, such as configuring lineups incorrectly.

6. **Example Usage**: The `main` method provides an example of how to use the classes to manage players and matches.

This implementation adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, and includes necessary comments for clarity.

# Version(sys) Model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 Temperature: 0.7
## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Remove players from the specific lineup. Before removing a player from the lineup, validate whether the player is in the lineup.
7) Remove players from the team. When a player is requested to be removed from a team, the player must be removed from the match lineup simultaneously.
8) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as team, name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status.
2. **Match Class**: Manages the starting and substitute lineups, including methods to configure and validate these lineups.
3. **Team Class**: Manages a collection of players, allowing for adding, removing, and transferring players between teams.
4. **Position Enum**: Defines the possible positions a player can have.
5. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Contains a `main` method to demonstrate the usage of the classes.

### Notes:
- The code includes error handling for invalid operations, such as trying to add more than 11 players to the starting lineup or trying to add a player to both lineups.
- The example usage in the `main` method demonstrates how to create teams, players, and configure match lineups.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Remove players from the specific lineup. Before removing a player from the lineup, validate whether the player is in the lineup.
7) Remove players from the team. When a player is requested to be removed from a team, the player must be removed from the match lineup simultaneously.
8) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

```

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a player with attributes like name, age, team, jersey number, position, and registration status.
2. **Match Class**: Manages the starting and substitute lineups, including methods to configure and validate them.
3. **Team Class**: Manages players, including adding, removing, and transferring players between teams.
4. **Position Enum**: Defines the possible positions a player can have.
5. **FootballManagementSystem Class**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate the usage of the classes.

### Notes:
- The code includes error handling for invalid operations, such as trying to add a player to both lineups or exceeding the maximum number of substitutes.
- The `removePlayer` method in the `Match` class ensures that players are removed from both lineups.
- The example usage in the `main` method demonstrates how to create teams, players, and matches, and how to configure lineups and transfer players.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Remove players from the starting/substitute lineup. Before removing a player from the lineup, validate whether the player is in the lineup.
7) Remove players from the team. When a player is requested to be removed from a team, the player must be removed from the match lineup simultaneously.
8) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

2. **Match Class**: Manages the starting and substitute lineups, including methods to configure and validate lineups, and remove players.
3. **Team Class**: Manages a list of players, allows adding/removing players, and handles player transfers and sales.
4. **Position Enum**: Defines the possible positions a player can have.

### Comments:
- Each class and method is documented with comments to explain their purpose and functionality.
- Error handling is implemented to ensure that invalid operations are not allowed, such as adding too many players to lineups or removing players not in the team.

### Explanation:
1. **FootballPlayer Class**: Represents a football player with attributes such as team, name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status.
2. **Match Class**: Manages the starting and substitute lineups, including methods to configure and validate lineups, and remove players.
3. **Team Class**: Manages a list of players, allows adding/removing players, and supports player transfers and sales to other teams.
4. **Position Enum**: Defines the possible positions a player can have.

### Comments:
- Each class and method is documented with comments to explain their purpose and functionality.
- Error handling is implemented to ensure that the business rules are followed, such as lineup validation and player management.

## Description:
A football management system, with the following specific requirements:
1) Manage player information, including team, name, age, reigstered status and jersey number.
2) Team have transfer operation. Allows football players to be transferred in or out of the football team. Supports selling football players to other football teams.
3) Configure the starting lineup in each match. The starting lineup must include 11 players, at least 1 forward player (FP), at least 2 midfield players (MP), at least 3 defenders (DF), and only 1 goalkeeper (GK).
4) Configure substitute lineup in each match, up to 7 substitute players, and cannot appear in the starting lineup at the same time.
5) Only players who join the team can be able to join the the starting lineup and substitute lineup.
6) Remove players from the starting/substitute lineup. Before removing a player from the lineup, validate whether the player is in the lineup.
7) Remove players from the team. When a player is requested to be removed from a team, the player must be removed from the match lineup simultaneously.
8) The team can participate in multiple matches, and the starting lineup and substitute lineup can be different in each match.

### Explanation:

1. **FootballPlayer**: This class manages player information, including their team, name, age, jersey number, position, and registration status.

2. **Match**: This class manages the match details, including starting and substitute lineups. It includes methods to configure lineups and validate them according to the specified requirements.

3. **Team**: This class manages the football team, including players and their participation in matches. It includes methods to add, remove, and transfer players.

4. **FootballManagementSystem**: This class contains an example usage of the implemented classes, demonstrating how to create teams, players, matches, and configure lineups.

### Comments:
- The code includes comments to explain the functionality.
- Error checking is performed when configuring lineups to ensure the requirements are met.
- The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the classes to create a team and manage players. 

Feel free to expand upon this example further or integrate it into a larger application as needed!
