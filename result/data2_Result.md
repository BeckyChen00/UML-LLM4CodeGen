## Prompt:# Task: 
Based on the <System functional requirements> and <UML class diagram> provided as input, generate a complete Java code.

## Input:
- System functional requirements: 
A simple educational management system that can implement the following functions:
1) Record student details, encompassing student ID and name.
2) Handle course specifics, which include course ID, course name, course credits, and course overview.
3) Keep track of students' course enrollment times and grades, allowing students to retake the same course multiple times.
4) Retrieve all the distinct courses enrolled by a student.
5) Canculate a unique course grade as the highest mark obtained by the student.
6) Canculate the total credits accumulated by a student, where only the credit of a unique course counts if the course grade is 60 or more.

- UML class diagram (in plantuml format): 
```plantuml

note:  class diagram

class Student {
    - string sid
    - string name

    + double calculateAccumulatedCredits()
    + List<Course> retrieveUniqueCoursesEnrolled()

## Note:
- Generate Java code, including classes, fields, and methods. Every method must have complete logic implementation.
- You are free to add helper methods and fields in the code if needed.
- Code shoule avoid placeholder implementations and use actual logic instead of pseudocode.
- Code should be as error-free as possible and conform to Java coding standards and best practices.
- The code should include necessary comments.
- You are encouraged to use the methods defined in <UML class diagram> to implement the code. And code should demonstrate object interactions shown in UML relationships

        student.enrollInCourse(math, 75);
        student.enrollInCourse(science, 60);
        student.enrollInCourse(math, 85); // Retaking math with a higher score
        student.enrollInCourse(science, 50); // Failed attempt, should be ignored for credit calculation

        // Calculate accumulated credits
        double totalCredits = student.calculateAccumulatedCredits();

        // Calculate the highest score in a course
        double highestMathScore = student.calculateCourseGrade(math);
        System.out.println("Highest score in Mathematics: " + highestMathScore);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Course Class**: Represents a course with details like ID, name, credits, and description. It includes a method to retrieve the credits for the course.
2. **Enrollment Class**: Represents an enrollment of a student in a course along with the score obtained in that course.
3. **Student Class**:
   - Contains methods for enrollment, calculating accumulated credits, retrieving unique courses, and calculating course grades.
   - Uses collections like `List` and `Set` to manage enrollments and unique courses efficiently.
4. **Main Class (`EducationalManagementSystem`)**: Demonstrates the creation of courses, student enrollment, and calculations as per the requirements.

The code is structured, maintains good naming conventions, and includes comments to make it easy to understand.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Classes**:
   - `Student`: Represents a student with methods to enroll in courses, retrieve distinct courses, calculate unique course grades, and total credits.
   - `Course`: Represents a course with attributes like course ID, name, credits, and overview.
   - `Enrollment`: Represents the relationship between a student and a course, including the grade received.

2. **EducationalManagementSystem**: This class manages students and courses, providing methods to add students and courses, enroll students in courses, and retrieve information.

3. **Main Method**: Demonstrates the functionality of the system by adding students and courses, enrolling students, and retrieving their information.

### Comments:
- The code is structured to be clear and maintainable, following Java coding standards.
- Error handling is included for cases where a student or course is not found during enrollment.
- The logic for calculating unique grades and total credits is implemented as per the requirements.

## Prompt:# Task: 
Based on the <System functional requirements> and <UML class diagram> provided as input, generate a complete Java code.

## Input:
- System functional requirements: 
A simple educational management system that can implement the following functions:
1) Record student details, encompassing student ID and name.
2) Handle course specifics, which include course ID, course name, course credits, and course overview.
3) Keep track of students' course enrollment times and grades, allowing students to retake the same course multiple times.
4) Retrieve all the distinct courses enrolled by a student.
5) Canculate a unique course grade as the highest mark obtained by the student.
6) Canculate the total credits accumulated by a student, where only the credit of a unique course counts if the course grade is 60 or more.

- UML class diagram (in plantuml format): 
```plantuml
@startuml
note:  class diagram

class Student {
    - string sid
    - string name

    + double calculateAccumulatedCredits()
    + List<Course> retrieveUniqueCoursesEnrolled()
    + double calculateCourseGrade(Course course)
}

class Course {
    - string cid
    - string name
    - double credit
    - string description

    + double getCredit()
}

class Enrollment {
    - double score    
}

   - Provides methods to calculate accumulated credits, retrieve unique courses, and calculate the highest grade for a course.

2. **Course Class**:
   - Represents a course with attributes like `cid`, `name`, `credit`, and `description`.
   - Overrides `equals` and `hashCode` to ensure uniqueness based on `cid`.

3. **Enrollment Class**:
   - Represents a student's enrollment in a course, storing the `score` and the `enrolledCourse`.

4. **EducationalManagementSystem Class**:
   - Demonstrates the functionality by creating courses, enrolling a student, and calculating results.

This implementation adheres to Java coding standards and best practices, with proper encapsulation, method implementation, and object interactions as per the UML diagram.
