The requirements associated with the functionality of the APAF ground data system are itemized in the table below.  The mnemonic FR is used in the requirement identifiers to show that these requirements are Functional Requirements unless otherwise specified. 
The APAF system shall acquire the telemetry data of the ASPERA-3 Experiment and Mars Express Orbit/Attitude from ESOC. 
The APAF system shall process all ASPERA-3 science data into IDFS data sets. 
The APAF system shall process the 
engineering and ancillary information necessary for calibration and science validation into IDFS data sets. 
Intermediate files of cleaned-up 
ASPERA-3 and MEX OA 
telemetry shall be generated in the event that cleaned-up telemetry is not provided by ESOC. 
The ASPERA-3 and MEX OA 
telemetry data shall be stored on a local SwRI archive. 
The ASPERA-3 and MEX OA 
IDFS data sets shall be stored on a local SwRI archive. 
Any APAF-generated intermediate files of ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry shall be stored on a local SwRI archive. 
Web-based displays of the most current ASPERA-3 data shall be provided for public view. 
Web-based displays defined by the ASPERA-3 team shall be provided where any available ASPERA-3 data (as opposed to just the most current) can be used for scientific analysis. 
Requirement Description 
The web-based displays defined by the ASPERA-3 team to be used for science analysis shall be password protected until the ASPERA-3 data is made public. 
The APAF ground data system shall have built-in error handling. 
ASPERA-3 and MEX OA IDFS data and any APAF-generated intermediate files of ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry shall be provided to all ASPERA-3 Co-I’s. 
IDFS data access software developed by SwRI shall be made available to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s. 
Science analysis software developed by SwRI to analyze IDFS-formatted data shall be made available to the ASPERA-3 Co-I’s.
