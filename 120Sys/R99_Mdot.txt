IS – Input Services 
Input Services provide the ability for DUAP:
To interact with other systems providing data to DUAP.
The system shall collect probe vehicle data. 
The ability to collect probe vehicle data is one of the primary purposes of the DUAP project. 
The DUAP data elements shall include probe vehicle data fields corresponding to the SAE J2735 format as enumerated in APPENDIX C - SAE J2735 Probe Data Elements. 
Probe Data Elements for probe data elements to be included. 
The DUAP Input Services shall be able to collect probe vehicle data from the VII Proof of Concept (POC) Probe Data Service (PDS) using the X-031 interface. 
The ability to collect probe vehicle data is one of the primary purposes of the DUAP project. 
The DUAP Input Services shall be able to collect probe vehicle data from the Chrysler Fast Feedback (telematics demonstration) fleet using the Chrysler telematics interface. 
The specific format of the interface is to be determined in the design of the prototype. 
The DUAP Input Services shall be able to collect probe vehicle data from Southeast Michigan Snow and Ice Management (SEMSIM) using the SEMSIM interface.
The specific format of the interface is to be determined in the design of the prototype.

The DUAP Input Services shall be able to collect probe vehicle data from the car rental fleets using the car rental fleets’ interfaces. 
The specific format of the interface is to be determined in the design of the prototype. 
The DUAP System shall be able to collect weather data. 
They are inferred to be a high-level requirement since winter operations are one of the critical aspects of the DUAP project. 
The DUAP Input Services shall be able to collect weather data from the Road Commission for Oakland County (RCOC) Road Weather Information Systems (RWIS) using the RCOC RWIS interface. 
The specific format of the interface is to be determined in the design of the prototype.
