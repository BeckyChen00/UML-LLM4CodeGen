System Features
Description and Priority
Instant Messaging allows students and professors to interact and talk in real-time. Instead of leaving each other messages on boards and going to chat rooms where screens are not refreshed in less than 60 sec, students will be able to see who is online and talk to them immediately. If a professor is marked online, students can ask questions and receive answers from the professor almost instantaneously. This feature is of High Priority, and students will be able to benefit from this feature because it will give them the feeling of an actual classroom, something that most students complain lacks when taking an online class.
