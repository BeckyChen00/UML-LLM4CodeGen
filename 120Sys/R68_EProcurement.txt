Business Processes
The scope for this specification is the procurement of goods and services for public sector organizations. This broad domain is broken down into four main business processes:

Sourcing
Includes activity before placing a formal order, including exchanging Catalogue information, Requests For Quotation (RFQ), and Quotations.
Ordering
includes Purchase Orders and responses.
Fulfillment
includes delivery/despatch notification, receipt (including variances), and Seller's proposed rectification of any problems.
Accounting
includes Invoices (including Self Billed Invoices), Credit Notes, Debit Notes, Statements, and Remittance Advice.

Interactions
Each business process involves exchanging information between the Buyer and the Seller using several Documents (see Table 1).

Sourcing

The Documents included are:

Catalog
is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to provide Item price and other information for use in locally held Catalogues.
RFQ (Request for Quotation)
It is a request from the Buyer to the Seller to quote terms and conditions under which the Seller is willing to supply specific goods or services.
Quotation
is sent from Seller to Buyer to: 
set out the terms and conditions under which the Seller is willing or able to supply goods or services; or 
in the case of "punch out" (where the Buyer orders on the Seller's website) to provide information for the Buyer's internal processes. 

The Documents included are:
Purchase Order
The Buyer sends it to tell the Seller that the sender wishes to purchase goods and services. It is a promise to buy. 
Variants may support revision or cancellation of the Purchase Order in content (Items ordered or quantity of Items) and fulfillment (changed delivery details, required by date, etc.).
PO Response
is sent by the Seller to inform the Buyer of the sender's intention to supply goods or perform services in response to a Purchase Order. It acknowledges that the Purchase Order has been received and will be fulfilled in full, partly or not. It may also give additional information about specific delivery. 

The Documents included are:
Fulfillment Notification
The Seller sends it to tell the Buyer that goods have been despatched or delivered or that a service has been performed. The Seller may use this Document to notify the Buyer of shipping details via a third-party carrier and to notify partial or complete delivery of a Purchase Order.
Receipt Advice
is sent by the Buyer to the Seller to acknowledge receipt in whole or part and to describe discovered variances, e.g., un-notified under-delivery, over-delivery, wrong Items delivered, or damaged goods.
Rectification Advice
Is sent from the Seller to the Buyer; to tell the Buyer action to be taken regarding the goods or services at variance from the actual requirement. E.g., the Seller may ask the Buyer to return the goods, await the collection of the goods (by the Seller or his carrier), or destroy the goods.

The Documents included are:
Invoice
is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to request payment for goods delivered or services performed. 
An invoice is a Value Added Tax (VAT) Document.
Self Billed Invoice
is an Invoice sent from the Buyer to the Seller where the two have a self-billing arrangement.
For more information regarding HMCE requirements for self-billing, see www.hmce.gov.uk/forms/notices/700-62.htm
Self Billed Invoice is a VAT Document.
Credit Note
Is sent from the Seller to the Buyer, confirming that the Seller owes money to the Buyer. It may be used to rectify errors and variances in the invoicing process.  
A credit Note is a VAT Document.
Debit Note
is sent from the Buyer to the Seller, stating that the Buyer has deducted amounts from a Seller's Invoice. A Debit Note precludes the need for a Seller to raise a Credit Note. 
Debit Note is a VAT Document.
Remittance Advice
is sent from the Buyer to the Seller, notifying payment and stating what Invoices, Credit, and Debit Notes have been accounted for.
Statement
is sent from the Seller to the Buyer summarising the status of the Buyer's account and the Invoices, Remittances, Debit, and Credit Notes submitted within a specific period.
