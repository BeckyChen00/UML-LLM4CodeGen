SYSTEM FUNCTIONS AND BEHAVIORS 
Case Investigation 
Electronic questionnaires must be developed and validated.  Investigators will design them to collect common data elements (e.g., patient demographics, test results, exposure contacts), agent-specific data elements (e.g., specific laboratory tests), and other customized data elements. 
Electronic questionnaires should provide the capability to accept digital signatures. 
Systems supporting OM must provide the ability to control the configuration of and revisions to investigation-specific questionnaires. 
Systems supporting OM must provide the ability to publish investigation-specific questionnaires and implementation guides. 
Case investigation should be supported by reusable questionnaire libraries that use common terminology (where available) to maximize the efficiency of data exchange. 
Systems supporting OM should provide a manual or automatic means of updating the status of case records as the case definition changes.  
Systems supporting OM should track the changes made to the status of case records due to changes in the case definition. 
Linking 
Linkages allow investigators to create meaningful analyses, characterize events, and identify at-risk populations.   
Systems supporting OM must support dynamically defined associations between entities to determine relationships.  For example, person-to-person (e.g., family relationship, exposure relationship), person-to-place (e.g., household, commonplace), animal-to-person, object-to-place, and person-to-travel.  
Entity-to-epi data links must match the entity to their symptoms, survey questions, specimens/samples collected, laboratory results, and prophylaxis and treatment data. 
Each new case must be able to link an assigned Entity ID to an Event ID within the scope of the investigation. 
Systems supporting OM require the ability to capture information about possible cases and potential contacts from the identification process through the treatment and follow-up process, as supported by linkages among entities, events, and actions.  
Laboratory results must be linked to corresponding specimens/samples including multiple results from one specimen/sample) and subjects when the participating laboratory returns the results.  These linkages must unambiguously associate multiple laboratory results to case and contact identifiers. 
If the specimen/sample was created from another specimen/sample (e.g., aliquots and new specimen types made from a source sample), laboratory results for the child specimens/samples must be linked to the corresponding parent specimen/sample.
