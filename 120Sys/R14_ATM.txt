Design the software to support a computerized banking network, including human cashiers and automatic teller machines ATMs to be shared by a consortium of banks. Each bank provides its computer to maintain its accounts and process transactions against them. Cashier stations are owned by individual banks and communicate directly with their own bank’s computer. Human cashiers enter account and transaction data. Automatic teller machines communicate with a central computer which clears transactions with the appropriate banks. An automated teller machine accepts a cash card, interacts with the user, communicates with the central system to carry out the transaction, dispenses cash, and prints receipts. The system requires appropriate record-keeping and security provisions. The system must handle concurrent access to the same account correctly. The banks will provide their software for their computers; you are to design the software for the ATMs and the network. The cost of the shared system will be apportioned to the banks according to the number of customers with cash cards.

设计软件以支持一个计算机化的银行网络，包括人类出纳机和自动柜员机，供一个银行联盟共享。每家银行都提供自己的计算机来维护账户并处理与之相关的交易。出纳站由个人银行拥有，直接与自己银行的计算机通信。人工收银员输入账户和交易数据。自动柜员机与中央计算机通信，中央计算机清算与相关银行的交易。自动柜员机接受现金卡，与用户交互，与中央系统通信以进行交易，分发现金，并打印收据。该系统需要适当的记录保存和安全规定。系统必须正确处理对同一帐户的并发访问。银行将为他们的电脑提供软件；你们要设计atm机和网络的软件。共享系统的成本将根据持有现金卡的客户数量分摊到银行。
